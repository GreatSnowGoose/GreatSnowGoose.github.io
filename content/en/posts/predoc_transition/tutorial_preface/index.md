As I'm leaving my current pre-doc position in mid-July, my supervisor asked me to create a brief tutorial for my successor. This tutorial could include things that are frequently used in my work or that I wished I had learned before I started. I was a little hesitant about this at first since all of the skills are quite task-specific, and the only thing I have consistently used is Google. Sometimes, I feel like I am too curious about too many things, so I may waste a lot of time looking for a one-time solution. Additionally, learning new things is the most fun part of the job. If I share too much, am I depriving my successor of the fun part of the job?

I soon felt reconciled to this. If there is too much to learn, then the fun part will never be depleted. Although I'm worried the skills are task-specific, there is some overlap, and I have always used what I learned more than once. It's still hard to say what I wish I had learned before I started, but I can share what I learned on the job.

Therefore, this series of posts is structured as follows:

**Part 0**: This article, which serves as a table of contents.

**Part 1**: Python and shell introduction, including Python installation, how to manage the environment, my preference for code editors, ten Python data types, condition syntax (if-else statements), for and while loops, and functions.

**Part 2**: Data cleaning with Stata and Python, including importing files, generating new variables, changing variable values, regular expressions, reshaping datasets, combining datasets, and saving datasets in both Stata and Python.

**Part 3**: OCR with Python, including preprocessing images to make them more easily recognized by the models, and using Tesseract or Textract to perform OCR.

**Part 4**: Web scraping with Python, including using Beautiful Soup to get information from .html files and using Selenium to navigate around webpages.

**Part 5**: Data analysis in Stata, including regressions, exporting regression results, and making plots.

**Part 6**: A little more on shell scripting, including basic shell knowledge and how to access the server.

As I am not a computer science major, the intuitions in my posts may not be accurate, and the solutions may not be the most efficient. I will try my best to make them accurate and welcome any suggestions and comments through email (unfortunately, for now, my blog does not have a comment system, but hopefully, I will make one soon!). You can contact me using the "@" button on the homepage and under my name. I will also update the posts as I update my knowledge on related topics.

Hope you enjoy.
